            Dr. Jigoro Kano (1860 - 1938), founder of Kodakan Judo, was born in the sea-side town of Mikage.  Not being a large and physically powerful young man, he yearned for physical conditioning and training that would allow him to feel as confident of his body as he did of his mind and spirit.  At the age of 18, he started studying the art of Jujitsu under numerous master teachers in order to strengthen his body, and attained an expertise in the art that was hitherto unknown.  Dr. Kano found that each of the various Jujitsu schools had techniques of merit, but no one school gave him compete  mastery.  Also, at this time in Japan, the Jujitsu schools had a reputation of having aggressive, thuggish students, who would use their techniques in an antisocial way.

            This led Dr. Kano to found the Kodokan Judo in 1882.  It combined a compilation of what was best of the Jujitsu techniques, added to the techniques and philosophy of Dr. Kano.  He wanted to teach not just a dangerous martial art, but a new system of physical culture and mental training that would benefit each student's whole like, and that of society as well.

                Number of years training martial arts?
            </strong>
        </h5>
        <p>
            I was introduced to the world of martial art philosophy as a young boy by my aunt who is Japanese. After living with my aunt and uncle I moved to Texas where my neighbor studied under the greatest teachers in the area.
            Later I moved to North Carolina and started showing martial arts to Military Personnel in Cherry Point Marine corps air station.
            After a few years teaching I moved to Greenville NC. and started my first school in 1995 while also learning the Chinese arts such as gung fu and Tai Chi,
            along with karate and Hapkido, since then I moved to Raleigh which is where I currently call home. I still study and practice what I teach,
            The relationships that my training has developed on and off the matt is one that cannot be explained in words. Its has been a true honor to have trained
            under the best in the world, and it’s a greater honor that these teachers are also my friends.
            I have had a rare privilege to represent such awesome lineage such as Sifu Jeffery Gay, William White, Carlos Machado, Royce Gracie, Scott Francis,
            Professor Ernie Cates, GM Cyrus, GM Jae Han Ji, GM In Sun Seo, GM West, Dr. Kimm, and Master John Taube.
